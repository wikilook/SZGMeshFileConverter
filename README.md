# SZGMeshFileConverter
Framework for converting 3D mesh files (OBJ - > STL)

The framework is a side project made for an application to a new job.

Notes:

  - The last state of the projects is in the development branch
  
  - I tested the framework with the .obj files included in the repository 
  
  - As I chose objective c as language I tried to use it everwhere, even where c functions for example would made the implementation much easier. Did not want to make a mess of languages.s
  
  - Lots of error checking are missing, i am just assuming that the inputs are somewhat correct. Due to limited time.

  - Tests are missing as well as of yet.
  
  - Documentation missing as well.

  - There are added features to the SZGMFMesh class which are not tested yet. I implied it in the comments.
  
  - Some features only work properly with certain type of meshes (watertight, convex, etc). I tried tos indicate these as well in the comments.
  
  - The SampleApplication is not made errorproof. No point really as it is for the easy testing of the framework, nothing else.
  
  - I will continue to work on this project regardless of the outcome of the application, changes/fixes are expected to come
